      "   - `created_at` (timestamp)\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. Format Conversions Needed:\n",
      "   - `fullAddress`: This field should ideally be broken down into separate fields like `address_line_1`, `address_line_2`, etc., according to the schema.\n",
      "   - `postCode`: Should be in a consistent format that matches the schema's `postcode_zipcode`.\n",
      "   - `gender`: The value \"Male\" does not match the expected gender values (either \"Female\" or \"Male\").\n",
      "   - `telephone`: This field should contain a valid phone number in an appropriate format.\n",
      "   - `contractNumber` and `regNumber`: These fields should contain numeric values.\n",
      "   - `commissionFlatRate` and `commissionPercent`: These fields should be numerical values, not strings.\n",
      "   - `timeSlot`: This field should be a numerical value representing the time slot.\n",
      "   - `taxNo`: This field should contain a valid tax number in an appropriate format.\n",
      "\n",
      "  3. Quality Issues:\n",
      "   - The `fullName` field contains \"Miss\" which is not consistent with the `gender` field value of \"Male\".\n",
      "   - The `locationName` field is different from the `defaultLocationId` and `locationIds`. It would be better if they were consistent.\n",
      "   - The `onlineGuid`, `online`, `fax`, `web`, and `orderId` fields are either empty or not used in this record, which may indicate inconsistencies or unnecessary fields.\n",
